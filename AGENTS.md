## Spec Validation

Before starting implementation (e.g. before running GSD), you MUST validate the feature specification, plan, and checklist by running:
```bash
node validators/scripts/validate-spec.js
```
If this script fails, do not proceed with implementation. If it fails 3 times consecutively, it will halt and generate a human review packet at `.ai/reviews/<feature-slug>/human-review.md`. To resume, fix the files and run:
```bash
node validators/scripts/validate-spec.js resume
```

## Verification Commands

```bash
npm run validate        # deterministic Spec-Kit validation
npm run test:validator  # validator unit coverage
npm run test:pipeline   # Phase 2 pipeline simulation
npm run test:cli        # CLI command integration coverage
npm test                # full validation suite
```

## Local CLI Commands

Use `node bin/adp.js <command>` from the repository checkout, or `adp <command>` / `saf <command>` when the package binary is installed.

```bash
node bin/adp.js init
node bin/adp.js new-session <name>
node bin/adp.js status
node bin/adp.js doctor
node bin/adp.js validate-spec
node bin/adp.js handoff
```

## Path Ownership & Folder Boundaries

- **`.specify/`**: Owns presets, templates, validation scripts, and the active feature pointer (`.specify/feature.json`).
- **`specs/<feature-slug>/`**: Owns canonical Spec-Kit files: `spec.md` (requirements), `plan.md` (architecture & changes), and `tasks.md` (checklist).
- **`.ai/`**: Owns mutable orchestration state (`run-state.json`), review logs, QA results, sessions, and durable project memory.

## Project Documentation

- `README.md` documents CLI usage, verification commands, and project structure.
- `CONTEXT.md` defines pipeline vocabulary and current orchestration terms.
- `docs/prd.md` describes the full AI delivery pipeline blueprint.
- `docs/artifact-registry.md` owns path and artifact ownership rules.
- `docs/tool-routing.md` maps pipeline phases to tools, validators, and stop conditions.
- `docs/memory-versus-sessions.md` defines durable memory versus temporary session logs.

# RTK Token Optimization Rules
You are integrated with RTK (Rust Token Killer). When executing or reading outputs of system commands, you must respect the compressed structural signatures to preserve context tokens:

- Git Status: Interpret short hex indicators and bulleted branches (e.g., "📌 master") as standard clean working trees.
- Test Runners: Expect failed assertions only. Ignore truncated lines for passing suites.
- File Tree/Operations: Recognize that boilerplate directories (node_modules, .git, target, target/debug) are hidden by default; do not re-run commands to find them unless explicitly requested.
- Error logs: Focus strictly on the core stack trace signals; summary formats contain the complete execution diagnostic.
